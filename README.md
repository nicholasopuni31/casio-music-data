# Casio Music Data (MUSICDAT)
- This repository contains MIDI files/versions of renditions, including remakes of song bank/piano bank tunes and rhythms, from certain CASIO keyboards.
- I test these MIDI files on my Casiotone LK-S450 because the maximum number of characters of each one are 14.
- This repository is yet to be organized, so feel free to help out with it.
- Inside the MUSICDAT folder are 100 MIDI versions of tunes from my childhood keyboard, CASIO LK-90TV.
- In addition, the Other MIDIs folder inside this folder contains MIDI versions of demo songs from other LK and CTK CASIO keyboards with HL, A2, and AHL.
- There are two folders, in the Other MIDIs folder:
  - "Other Demo Songs" contain demo songs from other CASIO keyboards including songs that are requested to make its way into such keyboards.
  - "Unfinished MIDIs" contain MIDI versions of demo songs from CASIO keyboards that are currently under completion.
