# Casio Music Data (MUSICDAT)
This repository contains MIDI files/versions of renditions, including remakes of song bank/piano bank tunes and rhythms, from certain CASIO keyboards, with sound sources such as HL, A2, and AHL.
I test these MIDI files on my Casiotone LK-S450 because the maximum number of characters of each one are 14.
This repository is yet to be organized, so feel free to help out with it.
